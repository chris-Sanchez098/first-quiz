# Security Audit Based on OWASP Top 10

## Broken Access Control
* Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and functionality.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
* Regularly review user access privileges and remove unnecessary access.

## Cryptographic Failures
* Use strong encryption algorithms for all sensitive data, including passwords, payment information, and customer data.
* Implement proper key management practices, including key rotation and strong key storage.
* Avoid common cryptographic mistakes, such as using weak encryption algorithms or storing passwords in plaintext.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks in the web frontend.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS risks.

## Security Misconfiguration
* Ensure that all software components, including the operating system, web server, database, and application code, are running the latest security patches.
* Disable unnecessary features and services to reduce the attack surface.
* Follow secure configuration guidelines for all components.

## Injection
* Ensure that SQL queries in the Python backend are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
* Use security controls to prevent NoSQL injection if using NoSQL databases.

## Identification and Authentication Failures
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to prevent unauthorized access.
* Verify user identities securely before granting access to sensitive data or functionality.
* Store passwords securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms.

## Software and Data Integrity Failures
* Implement integrity checks to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications to data.
* Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of software updates.
Monitor system logs for suspicious activity.

## Security Logging and Monitoring
* Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
* Collect logs from all relevant components, including the web server, database, and application code.
* Analyze logs regularly to identify potential security issues.


## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Implement server-side validation of all URLs and redirects to prevent SSRF attacks.
* Use a trusted proxy for all outgoing requests to prevent attackers from forging requests to internal resources.
* Sanitize all user-supplied inputs that are used to construct URLs or redirects.

## XML External Entity (XXE) Processing
* Securely parse XML inputs to prevent XXE attacks, especially in API requests.
